Theme Options UI Builder for WordPress. A simple way to create & save Theme Options and Meta Boxes for free or premium themes.

== Description ==

OptionTree attempts to bridge the gap between WordPress developers, designers and end-users by creating fully responsive option panels and meta boxes with an ease unlike any other plugin. OptionTree has many advanced features with well placed hooks and filters to adjust every aspect of the user experience. 

Build your Theme Options panel locally with an easy to use drag & drop interface and then export a functioning `theme-options.php` file for production use that is i18n translation ready, with your custom text domain automatically inserted. 

And, in just a few simple lines of code, save settings to the database with a unique array ID so none of your Theme Options conflict with other themes that use OptionTree. 

Also, OptionTree now takes full advantage of the new color schemes introduced in WordPress 3.8, it looks and feels built-in.
